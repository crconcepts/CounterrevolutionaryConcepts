        Over time, the Breviary’s canonical hours have been misaligned from their original solar-temporal structure.
        This table compares the common modern assumptions with the traditional, monastic and theological understanding
        rooted in the Rule of St. Benedict, the early Fathers, and devotional interpretation of Christ’s Passion.

              <td><strong>Matins:</strong> Often recited during the <em>First Watch</em> of the night, usually soon after sunset by conventual monasteries. Many observant houses would pray it during the <em>Second</em> or even the <em>Third Watch</em>. Sometimes anticipated in the mid-afternoon by less observant communities. Structured in three nocturns, each aligned to one of the first three watches. <em>Devotionally, it marks Christ’s agony in the garden and arrest.</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Lauds:</strong> Prayed at sunrise or upon rising, sometimes delayed until later in the morning.</td>
              <td><strong>Lauds:</strong> Associated with <em>cockcrow</em>, the entry into the <em>Fourth Watch</em>. It was most often paired with Matins (and thus anticipated), largely because rising for the Fourth Watch was deemed excessively onerous by many. <em>Devotionally, recalls Christ before the Sanhedrin and Peter’s denial.</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Prime:</strong> A 6:00 AM office, seen as redundant and suppressed in the 20th century.</td>
              <td><strong>Prime:</strong> The <em>first hour after sunrise</em>, beginning the monastic workday. <em>Devotionally, Christ judged by Pilate.</em></td>

              <td><strong>Terce:</strong> A mid-morning prayer at 9:00 AM.</td>
              <td><strong>Terce:</strong> The <em>third solar hour after sunrise</em>, ending mid-morning. <em>Devotionally, Christ sentenced and beginning His journey to Calvary. Associated with the hour markets would open.</em></td>

              <td><strong>None:</strong> The <em>third post meridiem hora</em>, occurring soon after noon. <em>Devotionally, recalls the death of Christ. The 3 PM observance emerged later; ancient practice, drawing from Scripture, placed it slightly earlier.</em></td>

              <td><strong>Compline:</strong> A <em>pre-sunset “stocktake”</em>, concluding the day’s labours before the evening meal and retirement. <em>Devotionally, reflects Christ’s burial and the sealing of the tomb.</em></td>

      <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        These ancient hours were not defined by mechanical clocks but by the heavens themselves.
        The <strong>Roman Solar Time</strong> app offers a renewed opportunity to align life, work,
        and prayer to the natural rhythms once honoured by saints and monks alike.
