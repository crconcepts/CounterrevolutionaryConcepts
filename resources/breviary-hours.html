      <h2>The Breviary and the Broken Clock</h2>
      <p>
        Once, the rhythm of Christian prayer followed the rhythm of the sun. The Church’s liturgical hours—
        <em>Prima</em>, <em>Tertia</em>, <em>Sexta</em>, <em>Nona</em>, and the night vigils—did not tick by the
        hands of a mechanical clock but flowed with the arc of the sun across the sky. Noon was not 12:00pm by
        decree, but the moment when the sun stood highest. The canonical hours rose and fell with the seasons,
        stretching and contracting like breath. Monks prayed when the cock crowed, when the shadows shortened,
        when dusk fell—not by appointment, but by awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        This intimate bond between the breviary and the solar cycle was not merely poetic—it was formative. The
        day’s prayers were tied to light and dark, to work and rest, to toil and thanksgiving. Nature herself became
        a catechist, a silent yet eloquent instructor in the habits of sanctity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, that connection is severed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern schedules mark <em>Lauds</em> at 6:00am sharp, regardless of whether dawn has broken.
        <em>Vespers</em> is sung by electric light. The clock—once a tool of the monastery—has become its master.
        The Divine Office, once alive with the seasons, has been reduced to a sterile regimen of digital reminders.
        The ancient harmony between prayer and creation has been flattened into mechanical uniformity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not merely a liturgical loss, but a civilisational one. We have replaced the living day with a
        standardised fiction. And in doing so, we have lost not only our sense of time, but our place within it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Roman Solar Time project is a small effort to restore this memory—to recalibrate our sense of sacred
        time with the sun, the seasons, and the order that once governed both monastery and market alike. It is a
        protest, not against technology, but against its misuse: against a world that has forgotten the dawn.

Many observant houses would pray it during the <em>Second</em> or even the <em>Third Watch</em>. Sometimes anticipated in the mid-afternoon by less observant communities.

      <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        These ancient hours were not defined by mechanical clocks but by the heavens themselves.
        The <strong>Roman Solar Time</strong> app offers a renewed opportunity to align life, work,
        and prayer to the natural rhythms once honoured by saints and monks alike.
