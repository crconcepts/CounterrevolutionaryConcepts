    <p>
      Over time, the Breviary’s canonical hours have been misaligned from their original solar-temporal structure. This table compares the common modern assumptions with the traditional, monastic and theological understanding rooted in the Rule of St. Benedict, the early Fathers, and devotional interpretation of Christ’s Passion.

      <table>
        <thead>

        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Matins:</strong> A midnight office, rarely recited outside monasteries.</td>
            <td><strong>Matins:</strong> Often recited during the <em>First Watch</em> of the night, often soon after sunset by conventual monasteries. Most observant monasteries might observe it during the <em>Second</em> or <em>Third Watch</em>. Sometimes prayed earlier in the afternoon. Traditionally structured in three Nocturns, each linked to one of the first three vigils. <em>Devotionally, it marks Christ’s agony in the garden and arrest.</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Lauds:</strong> The morning office, usually prayed at sunrise or upon rising.</td>
            <td><strong>Lauds:</strong> Associated with <em>cockcrow</em>, the turning point into the Fourth Watch. Often paired with Matins. <em>Devotionally linked to Christ’s trial before the Sanhedrin and Peter’s denial.</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Prime:</strong> Historically placed at 6:00 AM. Often seen as redundant alongside Lauds.</td>
            <td><strong>Prime:</strong> Marks the <em>first hour after sunrise</em>. <em>Devotionally, recalls Christ judged by Pilate.</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Terce:</strong> A mid-morning prayer, around 9:00 AM.</td>
            <td><strong>Terce:</strong> <em>Third solar hour after sunrise</em>, ending near mid-morning. <em>Marks the sentencing and Christ’s journey to Calvary; associated with market opening.</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Sext:</strong> The midday office, typically at 12:00 PM.</td>
            <td><strong>Sext:</strong> <em>Sixth and final ante meridiem hora</em>, concluding before solar noon. <em>Marks Christ’s Crucifixion.</em></td>
          </tr>

            <td><strong>None:</strong> Prayed at 3:00 PM, often called the Hour of Mercy.</td>
            <td><strong>None:</strong> <em>Third post meridiem hora</em>, soon after noon. <em>Marks the death of Christ. Traditionally occurred earlier than 3 PM.</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Vespers:</strong> Prayed in the evening, often after dark.</td>
            <td><strong>Vespers:</strong> <em>Late afternoon, before sunset</em>. Followed by a light meal. <em>Devotionally reflects the removal of Christ’s body from the Cross.</em></td>

          <tr>
            <td><strong>Compline:</strong> The final night prayer, often before bed.</td>

    <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
      These ancient hours were not defined by mechanical clocks but by the heavens themselves. The <strong>Roman Solar Time</strong> app offers a renewed opportunity to align life, work, and prayer to the natural rhythms once honoured by saints and monks alike.
