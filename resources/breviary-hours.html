        Over time, the Breviary’s canonical hours have been misaligned from their original solar-temporal structure.
        This table compares the common modern assumptions with the traditional, monastic and theological understanding
        rooted in the Rule of St. Benedict, the early Fathers, and devotional interpretation of Christ’s Passion.

              <td><strong>Matins:</strong> A midnight office, rarely recited outside monasteries.</td>
              <td><strong>Matins:</strong> Often recited during the <em>First Watch</em> of the night, soon after sunset by conventual monasteries. Most observant houses would pray it during the <em>Second</em> or <em>Third Watch</em>. Sometimes anticipated in the mid-afternoon. Structured in three nocturns, each aligned to one of the first three vigils. <em>Devotionally, it marks Christ’s agony in the garden and arrest.</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Lauds:</strong> Prayed at sunrise or upon rising, sometimes delayed until later in the morning.</td>
              <td><strong>Lauds:</strong> Associated with <em>cockcrow</em>, the entry into the <em>Fourth Watch</em>. Often paired with Matins and thus also anticipated. <em>Devotionally, recalls Christ before the Sanhedrin and Peter’s denial.</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Prime:</strong> A 6:00 AM office, seen as redundant and suppressed in the 20th century.</td>
              <td><strong>Prime:</strong> The <em>first hour after sunrise</em>, beginning the monastic workday. <em>Devotionally, Christ judged by Pilate.</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Terce:</strong> A mid-morning prayer at 9:00 AM.</td>
              <td><strong>Terce:</strong> The <em>third solar hour after sunrise</em>, ending mid-morning. <em>Devotionally, Christ sentenced and beginning His journey to Calvary. Associated with the hour markets would open.</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Sext:</strong> A noon or 12:00 PM office.</td>

            <tr>
              <td><strong>None:</strong> The “Hour of Mercy” at 3:00 PM.</td>
              <td><strong>None:</strong> The <em>third post meridiem hora</em>, occurring soon after noon. <em>Devotionally, recalls the death of Christ. The 3 PM observance emerged later; ancient practice placed it earlier, particularly near the equinox.</em></td>

            <tr>

              <td><strong>Compline:</strong> A <em>pre-sunset “stocktake”</em>, concluding the day’s labours before the evening meal and retirement. <em>Devotionally, reflects Christ’s burial and the sealing of the tomb.</em></td>

      <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        These ancient hours were not defined by mechanical clocks but by the heavens themselves.
        The <strong>Roman Solar Time</strong> app offers a renewed opportunity to align life, work,
        and prayer to the natural rhythms once honoured by saints and monks alike.
