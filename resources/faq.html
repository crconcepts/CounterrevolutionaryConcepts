      <h2>Roman Solar Time</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>What sort of clock is this? It doesn't look like any clock I've ever seen.</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This is a solar clock. It measures the time of the day and night according to the method used by the ancient Romans. It is upon this scaffolding of time that the liturgical practices of Christian monasteries were structured.</p>
          <p>Of course, the clock dial itself is an anachronism – the Romans never used such a device. Like many other ancient civilisations, they measured the time of day using the position of the sun. Ideally this was done using a sundial, but in the absence of such a device, by estimating the position of the sun in the sky. The time of night was measured by noting the positions of known constellations relative to the polar star based on the particular time of year.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>What makes this form of solar timekeeping particularly Roman?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The ancient Romans divided the daylight into twelve equal parts, named "hours", and the darkness into four equal parts, named "vigils" or "watches". Because the actual amount of daylight and darkness varies through the year, the exact length of an hour or a watch depends on the time of year and your actual latitude.</p>
          <p>The nearer to mid-Summer you are, the longer the duration of the hours and the shorter the duration of the watches. Conversely, the nearer to mid-Winter you are, the shorter the duration of the hours and the longer the duration of the watches.</p>
          <p>The higher your latitude, that is, the nearer you are to the North or South Pole, the greater the variance in hour and watch duration you will experience through the year. Conversely, if you are near the equator you will experience very little variance in hour and watch duration through the year.</p>
          <p>This specific method of measuring time was developed by the Romans for their military.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Why did Christian monasteries adopt a military timekeeping system?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The Roman military divisions of day and night offered a simple and orderly way to structure time. Early Christian monks—particularly in Egypt, Palestine, and eventually the West—saw in this model an ideal framework for regulating communal prayer, work, and rest.</p>
          <p>What was once a tool of military discipline was transformed into a tool of sanctification. The hours became markers for divine office and contemplation, not for guard changes or watch duties. In this way, monasticism baptised a practical Roman system and turned it toward the service of God.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Why would anyone want to return to this old way of telling time?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Mechanical time is convenient, but it is detached from the natural rhythms of light and darkness that govern our daily lives. The Roman system reflects the real progression of the sun through the sky, inviting us to become more attentive to the natural order of time and to structure our lives accordingly.</p>
          <p>For centuries, monasteries and communities shaped their work, prayer, and rest according to this rhythm. The reintroduction of solar time invites a deeper harmony with the day as God created it—not by hourly precision, but by sacred proportion.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>How does Roman Solar Time relate to the traditional Christian day?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The canonical hours of prayer—such as Prime, Terce, Sext, and None—were not originally tied to fixed clock times like 6am or 12pm. They were intended to correspond with specific moments of the sun’s journey across the sky. Roman Solar Time restores this alignment, helping users experience the divine hours in their proper temporal context.</p>
          <p>This is not just about accuracy—it is about sanctifying time. Living by the sun restores a sense of sacred rhythm to daily life, whether or not one prays the breviary.</p>

      <h2>Using the App</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>How does the app help me follow this solar rhythm?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The Roman Solar Time app translates this ancient system into a modern format. It uses your location to calculate the exact moments of sunrise, sunset, and solar midday. From this, it divides the daylight and nighttime hours as the Romans did, and presents them on a stylised dial that reflects these changing proportions.</p>
          <p>You will notice that the length of each hour changes through the year, and the segments of the dial stretch and shrink accordingly. This visual cue alone can shift your perception of the day’s flow and purpose.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>What am I seeing when I first open the app?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>You are presented with a solar dial. This is the heart of the app: a stylised representation of the current solar day, divided into twelve daylight hours and four nighttime vigils. The hand points to the current solar hour, which changes in real time as the sun moves across the sky.</p>
          <p>The dial is colour-coded, with the canonical hours marked clearly, allowing you to see at a glance where you are in the sacred rhythm of the day. Optional features can show minutes and seconds, but the emphasis is on proportion and flow—not rigid scheduling.</p>
