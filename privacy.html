        <h2>Website Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>At Counterrevolutionary Concepts, we respect your privacy. This website does not collect personal information for tracking or marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>However, if you choose to contact us via a web form, your name, email address, and message will be submitted securely via a third-party service. Submissions are processed by <a href="https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy/">Formspree</a>, and are used solely to respond to your enquiry. This information is not shared, stored long-term, or reused for any other purpose.</p>
        <p>We do not use Google Analytics or other tracking services. No cookies are used beyond those required for basic site functionality.</p>

      <h2>Roman Solar Time Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><strong>Roman Solar Time</strong> for iOS uses location data solely on-device to calculate solar time. Your precise location is never required – a 3 km radius approximation is sufficient.</p>
      <p>All solar calculations, location access, timekeeping, and display logic occur entirely on your device. The app does not transmit data to any server during normal operation, and does not use third-party analytics, ad tracking, or background network services.</p>
      <p>The app includes a built-in bug report form for user feedback and diagnostic reporting. Reports are submitted via <a href="https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy/">Formspree</a> and may include technical information such as solar location, app state, or error traces. No identifying information is collected unless you choose to append your email address. By default, reports are anonymous. Screenshots cannot currently be attached. If an email is not provided, the submission is one-way and cannot receive a reply.</p>
      <p>If you choose to enable optional features—such as the display of solar minutes—this will involve a one-time in-app purchase. All transactions are handled securely through Apple’s App Store. No payment or purchase information is visible to us at any time.</p>
      <p>For privacy concerns, please <a href="contact.html">contact us here</a>.</p>
