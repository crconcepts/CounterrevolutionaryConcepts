        <h2>Current Project</h2>
        <p>
            Our flagship product, <strong>Roman Solar Time</strong>, is an iOS application that revives the ancient method of solar-based timekeeping. It divides each day into canonical hours and night vigils, following Roman and monastic tradition. The app uses on-device location data to calculate real-time horae and vigiliae based on the user's solar position.
