        <h2>Current Project</h2>
        <p>
            Our flagship product, <strong>Roman Solar Time</strong>, to be released in May 2025, is an iOS application that revives the ancient method of solar-based timekeeping. It divides each day into canonical hours and night vigils, following Roman and monastic tradition. The app uses on-device location data to calculate real-time horae and vigiliae based on the user's solar position.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Roman Solar Time</strong> bridges the gap between the low-effort precision that early clockmakers strove to provide and the traditional, solar-based timekeeping practiced since antiquity. For the first time, the chronolyte can enjoy the best of both worlds: a reliable and accurate method of timekeeping that also honours the natural rhythm of day and night.
